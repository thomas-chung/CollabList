Welcome to CollabList
---------------------
The idea of this app is just a play pan for learning .NET Core, GitHub + Azure CI, and container technologies. I have 
been working in this industry for a long time and technology has progressed much since the early days of AJAX/jQuery/php
etc such that I feel like it's time to learn entirely new things. Understand their tradeoffs, and what learnings I can
take from this project back to my work.

This app is named CollabList because the concept is one person can create a list then start adding items to it. The creator
can then invite other people to join the list and start taking ownership of things before checking them off. It's meant to 
be something for fun and isn't meant for some production-grade list management solution for everyone. I'd imagine if I were
to scale this thing up it would have a little bit more features but for whatever I want to achieve this would work.

Please feel free to explore and hit me up if you have any questions!
